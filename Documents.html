In this process, the most vital and core part is handling all the transaction related legal documents. Reside is an online platform supporting real estate agents by streamlining the transaction process. During my stay at Reside, I had the chance to design the new version of one of the core features, the Documents Center 2.0.<br><br>

                In the United States, the real estate transaction is a very cumbersome process consisting of different steps and stages. In almost every step, drafting and signing different kinds of documents among different parties will happen. In the past, agents will need to manually draft all required documents, send them for signing via email and manage all documents by themselves. Normally, the workflow could be generalized as below

                The generalized processing flow might look simple in the diagram above, but the fact is that the documents processing could happen through the whole life cycle of a transaction, which makes it a highly frequent behavior.

Given that, we wanted to identify more detailed needs of agents and missing functions in the current document center. Based on that, we will design the next version, document center 2.0, to further boost and optimize the document handling process.

                     Given the nature of the product, to understand how agents use the document center, we will first need to know the business logic of their documents processing. At Reside, there is a business team working closely with agent in daily work and they know agents' process quite well. Also, they work in the same office as our product team do, which makes them the perfect and accessible source of backstories. Both reasons combined, we decided to conduct internal stakeholder interviews with the business team as our first step of UX research. Through the stakeholder interviews, we were able to

                      To conduct contextual inquiries, we reached out to a selected group of agents and went to their workplace for close observations. During the contextual inquiry, agents were asked to go through the normal documents handling process they usually follow. There are several things we focused on:

                      Other than taking notes, with agents' permissions, we also recorded inquiry videos for other members on the product team who were not able to attend inquiries, so that everyone could observe and generate insights from their own perspective.

                       To distill our notes into actionable insights, after each contextual inquiry, interviewers and observers of the contextual inquiry “download” their notes by taking 10 minutes to extract the most important points from the session and record them onto color-coded Post-Its: yellow for facts about the workflow, red for problems, purple for ideas. Once all the notes are converted to Post-Its, they’re read out loud and attached to a poster board full of notes for each “master.” <br>

                      Our next step is to place all the poster boards side by side and start grouping relevant notes to help us identify common themes. We then organize the smaller groups into larger groups, making sure the bigger groups tell a coherent story across many users. Those larger groups of notes are what ultimately lead us to our final insights.

                <span class="point">Signature Management</span> <br>
                Only by receiving signatures from all parties can agents move to the next step of transaction. However, it's pretty common that other parties could delay documents signing for various reasons, even agents themselves could forget about giving their own signatures. Thus, monitoring and facilitating the signature request process become very important.

                Transactions documents could go through different statuses in the transaction life cycle. It's vital to have a way for agents to easily and clearly know status of all documents and take actions accordingly. Otherwise, the whole transaction could be delayed due to latent actions. Also, it could cause stress to agents as a result of losing track of an overview of document status.

                Other than sending for signing, agents could perform other managing actions on documents like archiving, downloading and forwarding. It was revealed that the current document center fails to support those actions efficiently due to the lack of document organization features and advanced interaction options.

                    From previous user research, we learned that the way agents manage their documents is usually by every sending for signing. Documents sent for signing in the same batch usually belong to the same group. Thus, we introduce "section" and "envelope" in the document hierarchy. Unlike the flat doc structure, documents sent will be moved from the active section to the sent section. Also, each sending will be an envelope containing all documents sent in that batch.

                     To add more flexibility to document management, we added more advanced document interaction options in Document Center 2.0.  When the thumbnail of a sent document is being hovered, agents can choose to either view the doc or select it.

            In the design process, we made a lot design decisions based on product strategy, user feedback and implementation feasibility. Here is an example of design decisions we made.

            Option one separates the forwarding actions from general document actions with the pros of always showing general action options, so that the most important actions are always visible to users. Option two utilizes the same area where general document actions live. Action options will change when entering forwarding mode, which centralize different interactions to make the interface cleaner and more consolidated. <br>

                 Given the nature of the platform, as the first step of research, it's always important to have internal stakeholder interviews with the company's business team to learn more backstory. Based on which, I will reach out to our users, real estate agents, to gain a profound understanding of their problem we are trying to solve through contextual inquiry, use interview and survey. After collecting all the research data, our product team will have a data analysis meeting to go through findings, from which more detailed product requirements will be defined and a roadmap for the feature will be created.  <br><br>

                 Guided by the research data, we use material UI design as our general design guideline and make customization as needed. In a small team setting, rapid iterations help us to try ideas and receive feedback within the team in short cycles. For a new feature, the first version is usually a trial to collect user feedback. What we will do is to design only the most prioritized functions into it while design it in a way enabling easy integration with future functions. Thus, the progressive design. Also by maximizing the reuse of existing UI components and design paradigm, we try to maintain design consistency 
                across the platform and reduce implementation cost. Another important step in the design process is keeping communicating with the engineering team and having necessary fallback design solutions accommodating implementation limitation. <br><br>

                The final step is to have a formal review with the engineering team, during which I will walk them through the whole feature and inform them with all my design rationales. Then engineers will evaluate the feasibility of my design, ask questions give comments. The product team and engineering team will work together to address any issues raised. Finally, I will address any required design change and deliver the final design spec for implementation.<br><br>
